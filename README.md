# A Power BI Analysis of Mobile App Usage -  Visualizing Digital Habits 
## INTRODUCTION
In our increasingly digital world, understanding personal device usage can offer valuable insights into how we manage our time and attention. This Power BI dashboard project delves into my own mobile device data, analyzing key trends and patterns related to screen time, notifications received, and the frequency of app openings. By examining this data, I aim to uncover insights into my digital habits, identifying which apps command the most attention, how notifications influence my device usage, and when I'm most engaged with my smartphone.

Through this analysis, I hope to gain a clearer understanding of my interaction with technology, providing a foundation for more mindful and balanced digital habits.

*Disclaimer - The data used in this project is personally recorded from my own mobile device and reflects my individual usage patterns. Any insights or trends identified are specific to my behavior and may not represent broader user experiences.*
